# Building an Online Business to Fund Your Travels

*The allure of remote work and the freedom to travel the world while earning a living is a powerful motivator. Building an online business can turn that dream into reality. But before diving in, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of this approach.*

## Introduction

Our family saved (not that much) and planned to live off our savings while we attempted to make an income with an online business.

**Spoiler alert:** Our plan didn't go to plan!!

We'd planned to build a travel blog business - but thanks to setting off in February 2020, we put that plan on the back burner. Some of the most well-known travel bloggers in the world watched their online incomes reduce almost overnight. It wasn't the right time to be starting to earn online. For us anyway. We only had a limited time frame, and we couldn't wait with hopes that the travel blogging industry would bounce back in time before our tiny savings account ran out.

We had a backup plan in place. High-ticket affiliate marketing. I have a post coming on that soon. This is commonly marketed as a freedom lifestyle business. I bought into the hype thinking I'd be one of the overnight success (back in 2018 - two years before we left) and I wasn't. I gave it a very good crack. I was waking up at 4:30am most days, writing, journaling, running ads, doing the inner work, yet it didn't translate to sales.

When we realized our blog wasn't going to work in 2020, I attempted to sell my high-ticket offer again, but I think at that point I probably had lost my belief in it (yes, I'm embarrassed to say I was one of those corny people writing cute copy about how high-ticket affiliate marketing was going to set us free).

Here's a bit of what we have learned about building an online business ðŸ‘‡

## Pros of Building an Online Business for Travel Funding

### ðŸ¦‹ Location Independence
An online business allows you to work from anywhere with an internet connection. This frees you from the constraints of a traditional office job and allows you to travel the world while managing your business.

### ðŸ¦‹ Scalability
Online businesses have the potential for significant growth. With the right strategies, you can reach a global audience and scale your income without geographical limitations.

### ðŸ¦‹ Passive Income Potential
Some online business models can generate passive income streams, meaning you can earn money even while you travel or explore new destinations with minimal time investment.

## Cons (more like lows) of Building an Online Business for Travel Funding

### ðŸ’¡ Time Commitment
Building a successful online business takes time and effort. Don't expect overnight success. Be prepared to put in the hard work upfront to establish your brand and attract customers. Despite some people pretending like it's a walk in the park, it's not. Be prepared for inconsistency and ups and downs while you're building. There might be great months, but there also may be times when you don't have any income.

**Tip:** In 2025 the effort required to build an online business is helped along with the use of [AI tools](/blog/top-50-ai-tools-2025). You'll have the support of an AI team of agents right from the start which can help you scale smarter and faster.

This is helping me re-launch this website, up next is my travel blog, [World Travel Ambitions](https://worldtravelambitions.com).

### ðŸ’¡ Self-Discipline
Without a physical workplace or boss overseeing you, self-discipline is crucial. You'll need to manage your time effectively and stay motivated to reach your goals. This means it's likely you're going to have to drag your ass out of bed earlier than the rest of your family (if you're travelling as a family) to get shit done. But on a better note, once you're generating income, you'll be in a great position to scale quickly. You may not need the help of a VA if you have the AI skills to support your business. However, if you want quality service, you may start looking to invest in a team if you've grown to a stage you can't manage with your AI assistants.

### ðŸ’¡ Technical Skills
Depending on your chosen business model, you may need to develop some basic technical skills, such as website management, online marketing, or content creation.

The great news is that AI agents greatly reduce the need to know all the nitty gritty. I just moved my entire site out of SystemeIO with so much ease. And now, it is very simple to build anything my mind can imagine, simply by prompting AI. It's never been an easier time to start an online business to fund your digital nomad lifestyle.

## Skills Required for a Successful Online Business

While the specific skills needed will vary depending on your chosen online business model, some core skills are essential for success:

### âœ¨ Digital Marketing
Understanding how to market your business online is crucial. This includes skills like search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, and email marketing. I've created a comprehensive digital marketing course specifically for aspiring digital nomads that's available in our Vibe Nomads Skool classroom. The best part? You can join for free and get access to exclusive strategies, step-by-step tutorials, and a supportive community of fellow entrepreneurs who are building location-independent businesses.

### âœ¨ Content Creation
Many online businesses rely on high-quality content to attract and engage customers. Being able to create informative, engaging content (written, visual, or audio) is a valuable asset.

AI can totally turbocharge your content creation, everything from automating the whole process for those who aren't writers, to being a sidekick for those who do. It's handy to have an editor, copywriter and SEO guide on standby to check your work, regardless of how hands-on you choose to be. Whether you need blog posts, social media content, or email newsletters, AI tools can help you create polished, professional content in a fraction of the time.

### âœ¨ Customer Service
Providing excellent customer service is essential for building a loyal customer base and maintaining a positive reputation online.

This is evolving and chatbots are everywhere. Quality ones too. You can set these up to help you scale and support the growth of your business right away. Modern AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries, provide product information, and even troubleshoot common issuesâ€”all while you're enjoying your travels or focusing on other aspects of your business.

### âœ¨ Financial Management
Understanding basic financial management, including budgeting, pricing strategies, and tracking income and expenses, is crucial for business success.

With great integrations in your AI tools, all of this stuff is getting easier by the day. Throw in some dashboards which make it very easy to see your growth, you're running like a pro in 2025 even when you're solo. Modern financial tools can automatically categorize expenses, generate reports, forecast revenue, and even help with tax preparationâ€”perfect for digital nomads who need to manage finances across different currencies and countries.
