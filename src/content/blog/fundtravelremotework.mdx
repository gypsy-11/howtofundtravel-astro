# How Remote Work Funds Our Family's Adventures (and Can Fund Yours Too!)

*Discover how remote work can fund your family's travel adventures. Learn from our experience working from Vietnam, Turkey, Greece, Spain and more since 2021.*

## Introduction

The dream of working remotely and travelling the world with your family is no longer just a fantasy. It's been around a while, but since 2020 there has been an explosion of opportunities to work remotely.

In June 2021, that dream became a reality for us! Thanks to the flexibility and freedom of remote work, we've been able to explore new destinations, experience diverse cultures, and create lasting memories together.

We've worked from Vietnam, Turkey, Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, back to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and New Zealand. We've even done a full round the world from Auckland New Zealand to New York, USA, back to New Zealand, over to Malaysia, to Spain, the UK, a trans-atlantic cruise (thanks Starlink), Caribbean islands, a couple of months in Dominican Republic, Colombia, Panama, Japan... And of course, back to our favourite place, Vietnam.

## How We Make It Work

Since 2021, the key to our nomadic lifestyle has been my remote job as a social media support specialist for a cryptocurrency wallet company.

I took this role in mid-2021 because our funds were almost dried up, and I was really worried our sole income stream was too reliant on third parties. It turns out my instincts were on point as shortly after I started work, our crypto platform reduced payments, and soon after, completely stopped payments. It was my first lesson in Pay to Profit platforms - I'll get into those in another blog soon. Be wary of anyone selling things where you need to 'invest' and earn a return. Especially when it is focused on crypto. You could lose a lot more than money (friends, your reputation - you name it).

## How Did I Get This Job?

Since around 2015, I began learning everything I could about online incomes and businesses. I had tried everything from blogging to coaching and courses, even high-ticket affiliate marketing.

Along the way, I invested tens of thousands into coaches, mentors and courses. One area in which I felt I learned a lot of valuable skills, and helped my online presence take off, was digital marketing.

Back in 2019, I invested in the Affiliate Institute as a founding member (I can't remember exactly how much I paid, but it was around $2k USD). Now, I think it still exists, but I can't even access the training. So don't buy something that costs $2K that you can't even access a couple of years down the track. That's just silly.

In saying that, it was excellent quality, and I learned a lot through many online live classes. I started running ads and refined my copywriting skills. I learned about attraction marketing.

It was the skills I learned during this time building my businesses, and building my online presence that helped me cross the line for my role!

## Benefits of Remote Work for Funding your Travel

### Location Independence
Remote work allows you to work from anywhere with a decent internet connection. This frees you from the constraints of a traditional office job and opens doors to travel opportunities.

### Flexible Hours
Many remote jobs offer flexible schedules, allowing you to work around your travel plans and family commitments. I'm fortunate to be able to schedule 30-40 hours a week around my life. And it's worked for us!

### Work-Life Balance
Remote work can often lead to a better work-life balance. You can structure your workday to accommodate travel experiences and spend quality time with loved ones.

### Increased Productivity and Focus
Remote workers often report higher productivity levels due to fewer office distractions, reduced interruptions from colleagues, and the ability to create personalized work environments that suit our concentration needs.

*Side note: It's a lot less stressful building your side incomes when you have a steady income stream. It's even better if it's a remote role since you can then leverage lower cost-of-living countries while you build out your ultimate lifestyle.*

It covers everything from time blocking and accommodation selection to time zone management and tech setup.

## Our Remote Work Journey

Since 2021, we've worked from over 15 countries across 4 continents. Each location has brought its own unique challenges, rewards, and valuable lessons. Here's our journey through different regions:

### Europe: Beautiful but Challenging
Europe offered rich cultural experiences but came with its own challenges:

#### Turkey: Remote Work in the Countryside
- **Internet Surprise**: I had no idea about the internet quality in Turkey until we arrived. It was terrible! I had to arrange special internet setup while house sitting in the middle of nowhere.

#### Spain: The Importance of Speaking Up
- **Hidden Internet Fix**: In Spain, we experienced frustrating WiFi issues for months. I discovered the best thing to do is contact the landlord because sometimes the provider can fix the connection remotely. Once I finally spoke up about it, our speed improved drastically.
- **Valuable Lesson**: Don't suffer in silence with tech issues! The second half of our stay was much more productive after addressing the problem that could have been fixed earlier.

#### Bulgaria: Understanding Shared Infrastructure
- **Floor-Based Routers**: In Bulgaria, we experienced apartment living with routers shared per floor rather than per unit.
- **Peak Time Planning**: We learned to schedule important calls and bandwidth-heavy tasks outside of peak usage times when internet speeds would slow down.
- **Adapting Work Hours**: This experience taught us to be flexible with our schedule, sometimes shifting work earlier or later to access better connectivity.

#### General European Experiences
- **Higher Costs**: Beautiful cities and rich culture come with higher living expenses.
- **Excellent Infrastructure**: Despite occasional challenges, the reliable infrastructure generally made work easy.
- **Time Zone Advantage**: European time zones worked well for collaborating with both Asian and US colleagues.

### Latin America: Vibrant but Variable
Our time in Latin America was filled with warmth and challenges:
- **Power Outages in Dominican Republic**: Frequent electrical outages taught us the value of backup plans.
- **Variable Internet**: Quality varied dramatically between locations.
- **Affordable Living**: Lower costs allowed us to enjoy comfortable accommodations.
- **Hotel Room Escapes**: In affordable countries like these, hotel rooms came in handy when I needed extra quiet time away from family noise for important calls.

### Asia Pacific: Diverse Experiences
The Asia Pacific region offered incredible diversity:

#### Vietnam: Our Favorite Base
Vietnam has become our favorite long-term base for many reasons:
- **Affordability for Families**: We love Vietnam because I can afford a larger house, which is essential with four children.
- **Excellent Internet**: Reliable connectivity makes work seamless.
- **Strategic Location**: It's close enough for family to visit from New Zealand.
- **Power Solutions**: Vietnam has occasional power issues, but coworking spaces and cafes with generators have saved many workdays.
- **Food and Culture**: The amazing food and friendly people make daily life enjoyable.

#### New Zealand: Home Country Challenges
- **Starlink Solution**: I bought a Starlink in New Zealand because the only internet available at our home was poor ADSL. It was a game-changer for remote locations.
- **Different Community Dynamic**: We found fewer worldschool families and many were traveling faster. However, we had slowed down and managed to connect with a few local homeschoolers which was great.
- **Family Connections**: Being closer to extended family was valuable but came with its own scheduling challenges.

#### Malaysia: Urban Convenience with Challenges
- **Mall Living**: We enjoyed our time in Malaysia, living right on top of a mall in Petaling Jaya. This unique setup provided endless entertainment options just an elevator ride away.
- **Social Connections**: There was plenty to do for the kids, they could easily meet their friends, and we had our own social circle nearby.
- **Creative Internet Solutions**: Our apartment's internet came with a unique challengeâ€”it was connected to a router in a different apartment! This taught us adaptability, as we learned to schedule important calls during more stable hours and developed backup workflows.
- **Tech Lesson Learned**: I'd initially invested in the wrong SIM card for the area, which taught us the importance of researching local carriers before arrival. Despite occasional connectivity hiccups, the convenience of our location and rich social life made Malaysia a memorable experience.

#### Other Asia Pacific Benefits
- **Family-Friendly Options**: Many destinations catered well to children.
- **Good Urban Connectivity**: Major cities generally offered reliable internet (with our Malaysia experience being the exception that taught us valuable lessons!).
- **Diverse Landscapes**: From beaches to mountains, the variety kept experiences fresh.

### Managing Work Across Time Zones
Working across multiple time zones required smart strategies:
- **The Clocker App**: I use [Clocker App](https://apps.apple.com/app/clocker-world-clock-menu-bar/id1056643111) to manage all my timezones. It keeps UTC shown in my menu bar and makes scheduling much easier.
- **Clear Expectations**: We've learned to set clear expectations about availability with our teams.
- **Backup Internet Everywhere**: Mobile hotspots across different carriers have saved us countless times in all regions.

### Work-Life Balance on the Road
Maintaining boundaries while traveling required intentional practices:
- **Physical Separation**: Creating dedicated work spaces wherever possible.
- **Structured Hours**: Consistent work schedules that accommodate local experiences.
- **Regular Breaks**: Taking time to enjoy our surroundings - the whole reason we travel!
