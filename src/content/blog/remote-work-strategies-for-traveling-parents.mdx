# 10 Remote Work Strategies for Traveling Parents (2025 Guide)

*Master 10 proven remote work strategies for traveling parents. Learn time blocking, accommodation selection, time zone management, and tech setup to balance work and family travel successfully.*

## The Dream and Reality of Working While Traveling

Imagine working from a beach cafe in Bali while your kids build sandcastles nearby, or taking client calls from a cozy mountain cabin in Bulgaria as your family explores the surrounding forests. Sounds magical, right?

But if you've tried balancing full-time work with family travel, you know it's not always as picture-perfect as Instagram suggests. After 5+ years of full-time family travel and 4+ years of remote work as a family of six, I've learned that success requires more than just a good WiFi connection and a flexible employer.

In this guide, I'm sharing 10 proven strategies that have actually worked for us—real solutions that have allowed us to maintain professional success while giving our children the world as their classroom.

This guide is written for families pursuing **remote work family travel**—practical ways to **work from anywhere with kids** without sacrificing sleep, relationships, or delivery at work.

### The Reality Behind the Dream

Let's start with some honest talk. Many families attempt the work-travel lifestyle only to return home exhausted and discouraged. Why? Often it's a combination of unrealistic expectations, poor planning, and trying to transplant an office routine into a travel lifestyle.

> Success doesn't look like working 9-5 and then exploring exotic locations every evening. It looks like intentional time blocking, strategic destination choices, and sometimes trading tourist attractions for stable internet connections. It means accepting that some days are primarily for work, while others are dedicated to family adventures—and finding joy in that balance.

<p class="image-caption">Remote work and family travel can coexist beautifully with the right strategies and mindset.</p>

## Strategy 1: Master the Art of Time Blocking & Boundaries

The secret to making remote work sustainable while traveling isn't about working less. It's about working smarter with intentional time blocks and clear boundaries. Those guardrails must respect both your career and your family's needs.

For a practical framework to compress meetings and protect deep work, read [How I Compressed 35 Hours of Work Into 3 Hours](/blog/ai-productivity-breakthrough-35-hours-3-hours).

You can succeed as a travel family with remote full-time work. The issue is the rigid, office‑style 9–5 in a local time zone.

Most traveling families don't struggle because they work "too many" hours. They struggle because they try to copy‑paste an office‑style 9–5 into a life with time zones, transit days, and kids.

Full‑time absolutely works when you shift from "hours in a chair" to outcomes, core collaboration windows, and a predictable travel rhythm.

### Early‑start pattern (when sleep is solid)

If your kids sleep through the night and you're rested, start work early—very early—and finish not long after lunch. You'll finish a big chunk while the house sleeps and only manage the waking hours for half your shift.

You'll get to enjoy the sights and feel like you're actually travelling.

### Normal‑hours pattern (when nights are broken)

For families with tired parents (I'm one of those), the early‑rise "work before kids wake up" schedule doesn't work. For the last three years, I've raised a little pocket rocket who is super active at night and doesn't sleep through.

I've found living in a hot, tropical climate solves part of the issue. While I still work normal hours (generally 6–8 hours from 8 a.m.) it's ok because the heat in summer is a bit too intense to enjoy outdoors anyway. My husband finds the worldschooling activities that are taking place in air‑con places, and takes the smaller children out for the activities a few days a week.

This gives us the afternoons to enjoy at the beach as the heat cools and the sun goes down.

We find this is a great balance until our youngest decides she will start to sleep through the night and I can return to starting at 5 a.m.

### Full‑time friendly alternatives to a local 9–5

**Tip:**
- Pick one default schedule and run it for a full week.
- Protect 1–2 deep‑work blocks daily with calendar holds.
- Publish overlap hours so team expectations match your reality.

- **Core‑hours + flex blocks**: Agree on 3–4 daily overlap hours for meetings if you have these (I'm fortunate to work for a company with very few meetings required, most things can be sorted async); do the rest async. Keeps collaboration tight and gives you deep‑work windows.
- **Split‑shift schedule**: Early 2–3 hours before kids wake, 2–3 hours during quiet time, 2–3 hours in the evening. Matches family rhythms across time zones.
- **Compressed workweek (4×10 or 9/80)**: Same full‑time hours, fewer meeting days. Use long weekends for moves and recovery. If you can negotiate flexi hours (eg 30-40 hours a week), this helps. I've been grateful to have this flex option the past few years as quite often I will reduce down my hours to enjoy an extra day off per week.
- **Time‑zone arbitrage**: Base yourself 6–10 hours off your team so mornings/evenings become distraction‑free deep work; overlap during "core hours."
- **Anchor‑day cadence**: 3 meeting‑heavy "anchor" days (e.g., Tue–Thu), 2 meeting‑light deep‑work days. Travel Fri or Mon. Alternatively, if you find you enjoy doing the touristy things during the weekdays, find out if you can work weekends and take a couple of midweek days. I do this because I prefer to experience sites with fewer people around. And also, it is generally cheaper to book transport and flights midweek.
- **Sprint + buffer method**: Front‑load deliverables before transit; block a "buffer day" after arrival. Prevents missed deadlines from travel chaos.
- **Slowmad stays (4–8 + weeks per stop)**: Fewer moves = fewer productivity hits. Book family‑friendly stays with a dedicated work room. We've found that staying as long as possible really helps. After five years of travel, we decided to take a main base in Vietnam, since we just love it so much. For us, it works with proximity to family in New Zealand, it's a central location to access other Asian countries and even Europe, and we just love the people and food here. After 2 x laps around the world, we found that everywhere we went made us realize just how much we love Vietnam, and this made it easy for us to take a base here which we can come and rest whenever we like. And we can share our family friendly home with other family travellers when we go away.
- **Couples' relay or childcare swap**: Alternate coverage blocks so each parent gets two uninterrupted deep‑work chunks daily.
- **Meeting‑light agreements**: Create team "no‑meeting" windows and publish office hours. Record everything; use pre‑reads to cut live calls. Leverage Loom, quite often you can share what you need to communicate in Loom in a few minutes.
- **Outcome‑based alignment**: Set weekly KPIs/OKRs and define "done." When results are clear, no one cares if your hours are split.

### Example weekly patterns (plug‑and‑play)

- **Split‑shift week**: Mon–Thu core hours 10a–2p local; deep work 6–8a and 7–9p. Fri light meetings only; travel or admin.
- **Compressed 4×10**: Mon–Thu 8a–6p with a 2‑hour family block mid‑day; Fri–Sun for moves/adventure.

### Best remote work schedule for traveling parents

- Early start, early finish: protect sleep and keep afternoons free for family.
- Split‑shift with a mid‑day family block on high‑energy days.
- 4×10 during focused delivery weeks; use long weekends for moves.

## Strategy 2: Choose Accommodations That Work for Everyone

Where you stay can make or break your work-travel experience. The right accommodation isn't just about the view—it's about creating an environment where you can be productive *and* your family can thrive.

When we first started, we'd hop on overnight trains and say yes to anything "adventurous." Once I moved into a full‑time remote role, comfort stopped being a nice‑to‑have and became non‑negotiable. If I can close a door, jump on a call, and the kids have a cozy corner for books or art, we all win.

### Remote work accommodation tips for families

- Prioritize a door you can close, reliable Wi‑Fi (ask for a Speedtest), and a workable desk/chair.
- Map noise sources (construction, nightlife) and ask hosts about daytime quiet.
- Travel slow; test 3–4 nights, then extend once internet/noise pass the vibe check.

<p class="image-caption">Choose stays where a simple, quiet workspace is easy to set up.</p>

### Our Workspace Checklist (simple but saves the week)

- A real desk‑height surface and a chair (a corner of the master works great for me)
- Reliable Wi‑Fi (I ask for a Speedtest screenshot; 50–100+ Mbps down, 10+ up)
- 4G/5G backup and the ability to reboot the router
- Good light and a clean backdrop for calls
- Enough outlets plus a small power strip
- Quiet during core hours and a door I can close

### Family Amenities That Matter (what keeps us sane)

- Kitchen with basic cookware and a proper fridge
- Laundry (in‑unit or in‑building)
- Outdoor space nearby (balcony, yard, or a playground within 10 minutes)
- Sleep layout that actually works: doors on bedrooms, darker room for the kids
- Kid‑friendly extras are a bonus: a few toys/books, high chair/crib if needed
- Walkable groceries and pharmacy in a safe, quieter neighborhood

### Budget vs. Productivity (real talk)

> Cheap can be expensive. If bad Wi‑Fi or noise steals 3–5 hours of work, that "deal" wasn't a deal.

We'll happily pay $10–$20/night more for solid internet, a door I can close, and AC/fans. It pays for itself in focus.

### How We Book (what we actually do)

- We aim for longer stays. Monthly discounts can be 30–60%, and everyone settles in.
- We often book 3–4 nights first to "test," then extend once Wi‑Fi and noise pass the vibe check.
- We travel off‑season or mid‑week when we can, and avoid weekend check‑ins with kids.
- We scan reviews for "Wi‑Fi," "video call," "quiet," "construction," and map the area to avoid nightlife streets.
- We message hosts with a short checklist (script below) and ask for a desk if it's missing.

### What We Tend to Book (that consistently works)

- 3‑bedroom apartments or small family houses in quiet residential areas
- A desk in the primary bedroom + a separate living room for the kids
- Serviced apartments/aparthotels for transit months (reliable internet, laundry, weekly clean)
- For move days: business hotels with late checkout and sturdy desks/Wi‑Fi

### What We Pack to Make Any Place Work

- Laptop stand (like [Nexstand](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nexstand+laptop+stand)) - lifts laptop up on desks for better ergonomics, protects from unexpected spills, especially useful when working from cafes
- External mouse/keyboard, noise‑canceling headphones ([Bose QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Bose+QuietComfort+Ultra) or [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+WH-1000XM4) are great options)
- Compact power strip ([travel power strip](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=travel+power+strip+compact)) + universal adapter ([universal travel adapter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=universal+travel+adapter)), a small clip‑on light for calls
- A few books/toys, art supplies, and notebooks for quiet time (these go everywhere with us)

### Arrival‑Day Routine (10 minutes)

- Run a Speedtest and set up near the router if needed
- Choose the "call room" and set a do‑not‑disturb signal
- Stock snacks and water; set up the kids' quiet‑time basket
- Confirm hotspot backup is good to go

### Copy‑paste message we send hosts

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template Message for Hosts:</strong></p>
  <p>"Hi [Name], I work remotely full‑time and take video calls. Could you share a recent Speedtest from inside the apartment? Is the router in the unit (and can it be rebooted if needed)? Is there a desk‑height table and a chair suitable for working a full day? Are the bedrooms quiet during the day (no nearby construction/bars)? We're a family with kids and love longer stays—happy to book [X weeks]- 3 months if these boxes are checked."</p>
</div>

## Strategy 3: Leverage Time Zone Differences Strategically

Here's a mindset shift that can transform your work-travel life: time zones aren't obstacles—they're opportunities! When you travel with kids and work full-time, time differences can actually become your secret superpower.

The trick is deliberately choosing your overlap hours with colleagues and protecting your sleep schedule so you can fully enjoy those precious afternoons with your family. When you master this strategy, you'll find yourself with blocks of uninterrupted focus time and more flexibility than you ever had at home.

### Working While Family Sleeps (simple, calm, productive)
- **Early start, early finish**: 4:30–11:30 a.m. work block, lunch, then family time.
- **Split the morning**: 4:30–7:00 deep work; 7:00–8:00 family breakfast; 8:00–11:30 calls/overlap.
- **Guardrails that make it work**: early dinner (4:30–5:30), wind‑down by 8:00, lights out 8:30–9:00.

### Using Time Zones to Your Advantage (pick your overlap)
- **US clients while in Europe**: start early (4–6 a.m. local) to overlap US mornings; free afternoons.
- **US clients while in Asia**: choose either early mornings (4–8 a.m.) or short late‑evening overlap blocks.
- **EU/UK clients while in Asia**: late afternoon/evening overlap; mornings for deep work.
- **APAC clients while in Europe**: mornings align nicely; afternoons are yours.

### Time zone management for remote work with kids
- Define 3–4 core overlap hours and keep the rest async to protect family time.
- Use tools (Clocker, Fantastical, TidyCal) to simplify scheduling across time zones.
- Add buffer days after travel to reset sleep and routines before heavy meetings.

### The "Golden Hours" Concept
Your golden hours are the quiet blocks where you do your best work. For many parents: pre‑sunrise.

**Examples we love:**
- **Europe (Turkey, Greece, Spain)**: 4:30–7:30 a.m. deep work; 9:30–11:30 calls; beach afternoons.
- **SE Asia (Bali/Thailand)**: 5:00–8:00 a.m. deep work; 7:00–10:00 p.m. short US overlap if needed.
- **Portugal/Canaries**: 5:00–8:00 a.m. deep work; 9:00–12:00 calls; siesta‑style family time.

### Tools we actually use (and how)
- **[Clocker](https://apps.apple.com/app/clocker-world-clock-menu-bar/id1056643111)**: Menu‑bar world clocks so I can sanity‑check overlap at a glance. I pin client cities and plan calls without doing time‑math.
- **[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)**: Second time‑zone column + "Working Hours" rules. I keep two calendar sets: Core Hours (bookable) and Deep Work (auto‑decline).
- **[TidyCal](https://tidycal.com)**: Booking links that detect invitee time zones, add buffers, and cap meetings per day. I use separate links for 15‑min syncs vs 45‑min deep dives.
- **[Zoom](https://zoom.us)**: Recurring links + meeting templates. I test audio once, then reuse. Keeps mornings smooth when I start at 4–5 a.m.
- **[Loom](https://www.loom.com)**: Async status updates and pre‑reads. I send "weekly recap" Looms so we can cancel half the live calls.
- **UnDistracted**: Blocks social and inbox during golden hours. I schedule it to flip on before sunrise.
- **[Notion](https://www.notion.so) board (to‑do)**: Simple kanban with tags for "TZ overlap," "Golden Hour," and "Async." Daily view = 3 must‑ships max.
- **[Coda](https://coda.partnerlinks.io/agrv878j6von) (ownership + raise)**: One page that tracks shipped work, impact, and weekly wins. Easy to share for accountability—and to make a clean, data‑driven raise request.

### Case Study: Working for a US company in an Asian timezone role while we traveled Europe (what actually worked)
My favorite season was working "Asian hours" while we explored Turkey, Greece, and Spain. I started around 4 a.m. and wrapped up by midday. Afternoons were for towns and beaches, and honestly, those are some of my best travel memories.

**What made it sustainable:**
- **Sleep first**: early dinner (often 4:30–5:30), screens off, in bed by 8:30–9:00.
- **Noise control**: avoid streets with bars/karaoke; choose a bedroom you can close off from family noise.
- **Food plan**: in late‑dining countries (hi Spain!), we'd cook early or pack food so I wasn't eating at 9 p.m.
- **Home setup**: a corner desk in the main bedroom and a simple "do not disturb" cue during calls.

### Quick setup checklist (before you commit to a time‑zone plan)
- Is there a quiet, close‑the‑door space for early mornings or late evenings?
- Can you get to bed early (no clubs next door, blackout curtains, white‑noise option)?
- Do you have one 3–4 hour uninterrupted block most days?
- Are your meeting windows clearly published in your calendar tool?

### Communication that keeps everyone happy
- Add your local time zone + "office hours" to your email signature and booking link.
- Offer 2–3 recurring overlap windows/week and keep the rest async.
- Send pre‑reads and record calls to reduce "must‑be‑live" meetings during family time.

### 7‑day experiment (try it next week)
- **Days 1–2**: 4:30–7:00 deep work, 9:30–11:30 overlap; early dinner, lights out by 9:00.
- **Days 3–4**: adjust by ±30 minutes to find your best golden hour.
- **Day 5**: schedule errands/travel after 12:00.
- **Day 6**: review energy, sleep, and output; adjust overlap windows.
- **Day 7**: lock the routine and tell clients your stable availability.

## Strategy 4: Build Your Remote Work Support System

No parent is an island—especially not a traveling, working parent! Creating a reliable support network is essential for long-term sustainability on the road.

Work + travel stays viable when everyone's needs are met. For us, that means finding our people, establishing backup care options, and maintaining virtual supports that keep our entire family-work ecosystem running smoothly. The right community can transform a challenging day into one filled with shared solutions and laughter.

Work + travel stays sustainable when everyone's needs are met. For us, that means finding our people, having backup care options, and keeping a few virtual supports that make the whole machine run smoother.

### Finding Other Digital Nomad Families (how we actually do it)
- Search "worldschoolers + [city/country]" and local expat parents groups; join WhatsApp/Telegram threads for your dates.
- Post a "soft landing" message 2–3 weeks before arrival with kids' ages and interests; suggest one easy meetup (park/cafe).
- Aim for "family hubs" or seasonal pockets where parents gather. Example: in Hoi An, Vietnam, Feb–Oct is lively with family activities, day trips, and meetups (see [Hoi An Kids](https://www.hoiankids.com) for local ideas).
- If you have teens: plan longer stays (ideally 2 + months) and seek places where other teens are staying a while. Consistency matters after 13–14.

### Local Support Networks (babysitters, coworking, activities)
- **Babysitters**: ask in worldschooling/expat groups for personal recommendations, request 2 references, do a 1‑hour paid trial while you're nearby, confirm rate, hours, and emergency plan.
- **Coworking with childcare**: some spaces offer kids' rooms or partner daycare; otherwise, pair a quiet coworking near a playground so one parent works while the other does an easy outing.
- **Activities for sanity**: my husband thrives with sports (pickleball, basketball, beach touch rugby); I recharge small and quiet. Build those outlets into the week.
- **Find other mums**: I love meeting up with other mums for brunch or dinner, and other meetups. For example, here in Hoi An, we have a weekly meetup herbal hot tub and sauna which is a great bonding time.

### Virtual Support (keeps momentum when you're moving)
- **Accountability partner**: a 20‑minute weekly call to set goals and review what shipped.
- **Community threads**: small Discord/Slack groups for quick questions, wins, and travel tips. If you're not in a digital nomad group, you're welcome to join [Vibe Nomads](https://vibenomads.org) for support and community.
- **Async first**: Loom updates for work and family coordination reduce live call load.

### Emergency Backup Plans (when everything goes sideways)
- **Childcare**: a short list of 2–3 on‑call sitters; pre‑written "can you cover 2 hours today?" message.
- **Internet/power**: two SIMs/hotspots on different carriers, a nearby cafe or coworking with day pass, and a hotel day‑room option pinned on your map.
- **Noise/sleep**: white‑noise app, earplugs, a "call room" that can close, and a simple door sign for do‑not‑disturb.
- **Communication**: pre‑draft a brief "unexpected outage, back at [time]" note you can send in 10 seconds.

### About "Hubs" (proceed, but vet thoroughly)
Hubs can work well if both parents are working or you want instant community.

- **Do your due diligence**: verify business registration, ask about CPR/first‑aid training, staff‑to‑child ratios, safeguarding policies, and incident procedures.
- **Red flags**: defensive responses to safety questions, pressure tactics, repeated themes in poor reviews, or reluctance to share policies in writing.
- Talk to families privately who've attended; invite honest DMs. We've seen and experienced hostility from some groups when people speak up about poor experiences. Many people stay silent.

### Our Support Story (how we found our people)
2020–2023 was tough—few families were traveling and community was thin. We leaned hard on worldschool communities and slowly found our tribe outside of paid hubs.

Today, things are more active. In Hoi An, one family coordinates regular activities. It's a lifesaver for focus and sanity. With teens, we learned to choose places where other teens stay longer. They just don't connect with those who are passing‑through quickly.

Over time, the network compounds: a friend knows a friend in your next city, and soon you're planning adventures together. For example, we met some great families in Bulgaria in 2022/23, then travelled to Phu Quoc together early 2023, where we connected with even more families, who then travelled to Hoi An together. Then in 2024 some of us got together again for an epic Trans-Atlantic cruise from England to the Caribbean. 

### Copy‑paste scripts
**Soft landing post:**

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template for Soft Landing Posts:</strong></p>
  <p>"Hi there, we're from [home country] and arriving to [city] on [date]. We'll be here for [X] months and have [X] kids ages [range]. I'd love to meet up with other working parents or people with [shared interests of parents]. Also interested to hear your sitter recommendations."</p>
</div>

**Babysitter vetting:**

*Note: Because I have teens, I don't actually rely on sitters, but here's a template you could use if you would like to find a sitter:*

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template for Babysitter Vetting:</strong></p>
  <p>"Hi [Name], we're looking for a sitter in [neighborhood] for [days/times]. Could you share your rate, experience with [ages], two references, and whether you're first‑aid/CPR trained? We usually do a 1‑hour paid trial first."</p>
</div>

## Strategy 5: Master Collaboration Tools for Remote Team Success

The right collaboration tools can transform your remote work experience from chaotic to seamless. It's not about using every platform available—it's about building a reliable, efficient collaboration stack that keeps you connected, productive, and visible across time zones and cultures.

- Use calendar blocks to show "Deep Work," "Available for Calls," and "Family Time"
- Create a shared team document with everyone's time zones and preferred communication methods

**Optimize for Async Collaboration:**
- Default to async communication when possible—use Loom for updates, Notion for documentation
- Send pre-reads and agendas 24 hours before meetings to maximize live discussion time
- Record important calls and share summaries for team members who couldn't attend

**Build Team Relationships:**
- Schedule regular 1:1s with key teammates, even if they're at odd hours
- Participate in virtual coffee chats and team social events
- Use Slack threads for longer discussions and keep channels organized by topic

### Collaboration Tool Setup Checklist

**Before You Travel:**
- [ ] Test all collaboration tools from your destination's internet connection
- [ ] Set up offline access for critical documents and tools
- [ ] Create backup communication plans (phone, WhatsApp, email)
- [ ] Update your availability and time zone in all team tools

### Success Story: How Our Team Stays Connected

Our global team spans 8 time zones, and we've found that the right collaboration tools make all the difference. We use Notion as our central knowledge hub, Loom for async updates, and TidyCal for scheduling. The key isn't the tools themselves—it's the consistent processes and clear expectations we've built around them.

When I'm traveling, my team knows exactly when I'm available and how to reach me. They can see my progress in real-time through our shared tools, and I can contribute meaningfully even when I'm on the other side of the world.

## Strategy 6: Invest in Reliable Tech Infrastructure

The right tech setup is the backbone of successful remote work while traveling. It's not about having the fanciest gear—it's about reliability, redundancy, and tools that keep you productive no matter where you are.

Pretty gear is nice. Reliable gear pays the bills. We keep it simple: one solid setup at home base, a travel kit that works anywhere, and back‑ups for internet and power so a storm or outage doesn't wreck a workday.

### Essential Tech Stack (what actually travels with us)
- Reliable laptop (company‑issued if possible) + 16" portable monitor ([LG 16MR70](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+16MR70+portable+monitor)) in my laptop bag
- Noise‑canceling headphones ([Bose QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Bose+QuietComfort+Ultra) or [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+WH-1000XM4)) + external mouse/keyboard
- Compact power strip ([travel power strip](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=travel+power+strip+compact)) + universal adapter ([universal travel adapter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=universal+travel+adapter)) + USB‑C PD power bank ([airline compatible power bank](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=airline+compatible+power+bank+100W)) (60–100W so it can charge a laptop)
- Small ring light ([portable ring light](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=small+portable+ring+light)) or clip‑on lamp ([clip on lamp](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=clip+on+lamp+portable)) for early calls
- Optional: travel router ([GL.iNet travel router](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=GL.iNet+travel+router)) to stabilize flaky Wi‑Fi

### Internet Backup Playbook (rule of 3: two networks + one power plan)
- **Primary**: accommodation Wi‑Fi (ask for a Speedtest screenshot)
- **Secondary**: eSIM/data (we use [Roamless](https://go.roamless.com/OOq0/yen0eqnk) on arrival, then switch to the best local plan)
- **Tertiary**: a second SIM or partner's hotspot on a different carrier
- **Power plan**: high‑capacity power bank; in places with sketchy grids, look for homes with a generator. In the Dominican Republic, a generator saved multiple full‑day outages for us.

### Offline‑First Defaults (so outages don't stop delivery)
- Sync files for offline in Google Drive/Notion; prep docs the day before
- Keep an "offline work" list (writing, reviews, planning) ready to go
- Zoom fallback: switch to audio‑only, turn off HD, record a Loom afterward if needed

### Productivity Tools for Parents (focus by default)
- UnDistracted: blocks social/inbox during golden hours on a schedule
- Notion board: simple kanban with tags for "Golden Hour," "TZ Overlap," "Async"
- Coda page: track shipped work, impact, and weekly wins—great for accountability and clean, data‑driven raise conversations

### Internet Shopping + SIM Tips (save money, save stress)
- Don't buy SIMs at airports—prices are rarely the best. Use an eSIM (like [Roamless](https://go.roamless.com/OOq0/yen0eqnk)) on arrival, then buy the best local plan in town within 24–48 hours.
- Always check coverage maps for your neighborhood and ask hosts which carrier works best in the building.

### Company Gear (make the most of it)
- If your company supplies gear, ask for what keeps you productive: [adjustable desk](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=adjustable+desk) and chair at home base, external monitor(s), and a stipend for a travel monitor or power bank.
- Consider setting up a second base with a simple "plug‑in and go" workstation if you rotate between two places.

### Further research and data
- [Buffer: State of Remote Work](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work) for yearly remote work statistics.
- [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com) for community‑sourced city data (costs, internet, safety).

### What we actually pack (quick list)
- Laptop + 16" portable monitor ([LG 16MR70](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+16MR70+portable+monitor))
- Laptop stand ([Nexstand](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nexstand+laptop+stand)) - essential for ergonomics and spill protection, especially in cafes
- Headphones ([Bose QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Bose+QuietComfort+Ultra) or [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+WH-1000XM4)), mouse/keyboard, [power strip](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=travel+power+strip+compact), [universal adapter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=universal+travel+adapter)
- USB‑C PD power bank ([airline compatible power bank](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=airline+compatible+power+bank+100W)), small light ([portable ring light](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=small+portable+ring+light) or [clip on lamp](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=clip+on+lamp+portable))
- eSIM, spare SIM, and hotspot‑capable phone

### Host message (power + internet)

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template for Host Message:</strong></p>
  <p>"Hi [Name], I work full‑time remotely. Could you share a recent Speedtest from inside the unit? Is the router inside (and can it be rebooted)? How often are power cuts in your area, and is there a backup (generator/inverter)? Are there any known construction/noise issues during weekdays?"</p>
</div>

### Real‑life note from the road
In 2020 storms, mobile data kept me online through outages. In the Dominican Republic, a generator was non‑negotiable: without it we'd have lost full days, multiple times a week.

### Budget‑friendly swaps
- Buy refurbished laptops/monitors from reputable sellers
- One good power bank + a compact power strip beats carrying multiple chargers
- Monthly accommodation discounts (30–60%) free up budget for the right gear

## Strategy 7: Master Professional Communication While Traveling

The biggest reason full‑time remote + family travel works for me? I over‑communicate the right things, at the right times. No surprises. Clear availability. Solid backups.

### Setting Expectations with Management

**The "Travel Transparency" Approach (be proactive, not apologetic):**

**Before You Move:**
- Share a simple "Working From X" note with your manager:
  - Where you'll be, dates, local time zone, core hours, and meeting windows
  - Any known blackouts (travel days, visa appointments)
  - Internet/power backups and a phone number for urgent issues
- Publish your office hours in your calendar, email signature, and booking link
- Keep a living "travel calendar" shared with your team

**Ongoing Communication:**
- **Set clear expectations**: Let your manager know about your availability, including any fixed weekly timeslots you'll be unavailable (e.g., regular kids/mums meetup on Monday mornings at 10am). Be upfront about these commitments and offer to work different hours to compensate
- **Proactive Travel Communication**: Communicate your travel schedule in advance, including dates, timezone changes, and any potential connectivity challenges. This ensures you're on the same page with your manager, helps management plan around your availability, and prevents any surprises
- **Progress Updates**: Provide regular updates on progress, not just when asked. Share weekly summaries of completed work, ongoing projects, and upcoming milestones. This keeps you visible and demonstrates consistent delivery
- **Proactive Problem Solving**: Be proactive about potential challenges by identifying risks early (internet issues, timezone conflicts, family emergencies) and having backup plans ready. This shows you're a reliable team member who thinks strategically
- **1:1 Documentation System**: Create a shared document (Notion works well) where you document everything you're working on. Share wins, books you're reading, valuable conversations, and project milestones. Align these with company values and priorities so your managers know exactly what you're up to and can reward you accordingly with bonuses, raises, or promotions

**Maintain a one‑pager:**
- Current location, time zone, overlap hours, backup plan, and next move date
- Add a footer to your weekly update: "Currently in [City, TZ]. Overlap hours: [times]."
- Tell your manager People/IT implications up front: Allowed countries, tax/PEO rules, data access restrictions, VPN/MDM requirements

### Setting Expectations with Your Team

**With Your Team:**
- **Master Async Communication**: Use tools like Loom, Notion, and Slack threads for detailed updates that don't require real-time responses. Record quick video updates for complex topics and use written summaries for quick status checks
- **Context for Time Zones**: Always include times in an agreed timezone to avoid confusion. For example, at my company, we always communicate in UTC timezone. This keeps everyone on the same page and eliminates uncertainty. Use tools like Clocker to show multiple time zones in your messages and calendar invites
- **Schedule Transparency**: Share your working hours, timezone, and availability windows in your Slack status, email signature, and team calendar. Update these regularly as you travel
- **Relationship Building**: Schedule regular 1:1s with key teammates, participate in virtual coffee chats, and join team social events even if they're at odd hours. Small gestures like remembering birthdays or work anniversaries go a long way
- **AI Communication Help**: If you don't feel like you're much of a communicator, talk to ChatGPT or Gemini about what you're trying to say. This is particularly useful if you have written something really long and want to condense it. Prompt: "make this more concise and keep a friendly tone"
- **Flexible Coverage Planning**: Use in-house scheduling tools to self-schedule your hours while staying flexible when teammates are on annual leave or working from different time zones. Always communicate internally to ensure no coverage gaps. This builds trust and shows you're a reliable team player
- **Strategic Relationship Building**: Cultivate meaningful connections with key people across your organization. When people know you personally and understand your work ethic, they're more likely to think of you for opportunities, collaborations, and advancement. This "visibility strategy" ensures you stay top-of-mind even when working remotely

### Setting Expectations with Clients or External Stakeholders

**With Clients or External Stakeholders:**
- **Set realistic deadlines and expectations**: Map out projects using tools like [Asana](https://asana.com), [Notion](https://notion.so), or [Trello](https://trello.com) so everyone can see project progress and keep the door open for questions if someone isn't sure about milestones
- **Communicate clearly about deliverables**: Make sure to paint a clear picture of what you expect and have them communicate what their expectations are. Ensure that you're on the same page before signing anything
- **Provide regular progress updates**: Have check-ins at milestones. Communicate early if there is anything that could put a project timeline at risk. Remember that delays on your piece of a project could impact other parts of a bigger picture
- **Handle time zone challenges professionally**: Agree on a neutral timezone for discussions, and ensure you always convert your time to the agreed timezone. Use a shared calendar or booking system like [Calendly](https://calendly.com) or [TidyCal](https://tidycal.com)

### Handling Time Zones Like a Pro

- **Default to async**: pre‑reads, Loom walkthroughs, written decisions
- **Offer 2–3 recurring overlap windows per week**; keep the rest meeting‑light
- **Use booking links with time‑zone detection and buffers** (e.g., [TidyCal](https://tidycal.com))
- **Set response SLAs**: "Same‑day for urgent, 24 hours for normal, end‑of‑week for deep reviews"

### Creating Professional Boundaries (when to say no to work)

- **Create "no‑meeting" blocks for golden hours and family time**
- **The two‑slot rule**: you'll take either the early slot or the late slot this week—not both
- **If a request breaks your sleep window, offer 2 alternatives plus an async option**

### Security and Compliance (don't skip this)

- **Use company VPN/MDM, private networks only, and avoid public Wi‑Fi for sensitive work**
- **Confirm data‑access rules by country and any restricted regions before you book**

### Copy‑Paste Scripts

**Manager heads‑up (before a move):**

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template for Manager Heads-Up:</strong></p>
  <p>"Hi [Manager], I'll be working from [City, Country] from [dates]. Local time zone is [TZ]. Core overlap hours: [times]. Travel/buffer days: [dates]. Internet: [primary + backup]. Phone/WhatsApp for urgent: [number]. No changes expected to delivery; please flag any concerns or compliance requirements."</p>
</div>

**Calendar description (recurring overlap block):**

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template for Calendar Description:</strong></p>
  <p>"Bookable overlap hours (local time [TZ]). For other times, please use the async doc or Loom pre‑read."</p>
</div>

**Polite reschedule (time‑zone friendly):**

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template for Polite Reschedule:</strong></p>
  <p>"Thanks for the invite! That time falls outside my sleep window. Could we do [Option A] or [Option B]? Happy to provide a Loom update if that's faster."</p>
</div>

**Unexpected outage:**

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Template for Unexpected Outage:</strong></p>
  <p>"Quick heads‑up: local power/internet outage. I'm switching to backup now and expect to be back by [time]. Will send a Loom update if we need to shift."</p>
</div>

### Success Stories: Colleague‑Backed Proof

In my global, remote‑first team, several colleagues rotate regions each year and maintain strong delivery by agreeing on core hours, using async updates, and planning buffer days around moves. My own travel has let me attend nearby industry events and bring back useful insights for the team.

## Strategy 8: Turn Travel Into Educational Opportunities

One of the greatest benefits of a global work life has been exposing our kids to the world. While we are more unschooly than curriculum based, our children have learned more traveling than they could've ever learned in a classroom.

- They are highly self-aware and have a deep understanding of what it means to be human.
- They seem more mature for their ages (16 and 18) than many school-based peers and look at life through a wise lens.
- They read widely and invest in personal growth and their mental health.
- They understand that "book smart" isn't everything and have a depth of knowledge you can't acquire in one classroom in one town.

<div class="callout-box">
  <p><strong>Real Impact of Worldschooling:</strong></p>
  <p>My kids understand the diverse nature of the world. They are participating in real life, having conversations with all sorts of different people—conversations you cannot put a price tag on.</p>
</div>

I truly believe that worldschooling and global education is the first-class educational system for the current times. While traditional ed struggles to keep up and adapt, a flexible, self-directed learning approach ensures our children are the drivers of their education, and develops a love of learning which will be very important as the world changes more and more rapidly.

<img src="/images/optimized/how-to-fund-family-travel.webp" alt="Family travel scenario exploring nature together while living the remote work lifestyle" class="featured-image" width="1200" height="630" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />

<p class="image-caption">Family travel creates hands‑on learning moments—and unforgettable memories.</p>

### Worldschooling Integration (learning woven into the day)

- **City "micro‑curriculum"**: history walk + museum day, local market math, language exchange at a cafe, cooking a regional dish, nature journaling at a park.
- **The 3‑3‑1 rhythm**: 3 curiosities (questions they want answered), 3 experiences (places/people), 1 output (journal entry, photo essay, short Loom).
- **Conversation > worksheets**: talk to bakers, drivers, guides, artists, creatives, grandparents at the park. Those conversations are priceless.

### Work‑Life‑Learning Balance (so your 40 hours still work)

- **Split‑shift day**: early parent work block, late‑morning learning outing, quiet‑time reading/journaling, afternoon adventure.
- **Learning sprints**: pick a theme per city (e.g., "ancient trade routes," "marine ecosystems," "street food economics") and focus for 2–3 weeks.
- **Quiet‑hour kit**: books, art supplies, notebooks, kindles—kids settle, you get deep‑work time.

### Educational Resources We Actually Use

- **Core tools**: Notion learning log, Google Drive for shared docs, Readwise/Kindle highlights.
- **Learning apps**: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org), [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com), [Duolingo ABC](https://abc.duolingo.com) for toddler early language learning, [Mystery Science](https://mysteryscience.com), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) for coding, [EdClub](https://edclub.com) for touch typing, [Pobble](https://app.pobble.com) for writing prompts, [Outschool](https://outschool.com) for structured classes, and [Libby](https://libbyapp.com) (library ebooks).
- **Community**: local museum passes, guided walking tours (our guided tour of Ephesus in Turkey is an absolute highlight), language tutors, and worldschool meetups.

### How Travel Enhances Your Work (surprising compounding benefits)

- **Fresh problem‑solving**: new cities force creativity and calm under pressure—great for shipping work.
- **Communication superpowers**: different cultures = clearer writing, fewer assumptions, better async.
- **Industry insight**: conferences near you, on‑the‑ground observations, real user behaviors you can bring back to your team.

### Our Kids' Educational Journey (real life, real growth)

They read widely, care for their mental health, and see life through a wider lens. They know they'll "fill gaps" when needed—but they're building something deeper: self‑direction, empathy, and confidence in new places with new people.

### Simple Templates (copy‑paste and go)

**Weekly worldschool plan:**
- Theme: [e.g., "Ottoman history"]
- 3 curiosities: [question 1–3]
- Experiences: [museum, market, language cafe]
- Output: [journal, photo essay, Loom recap]
- Reflection: What surprised you? What do you want next?

**Learning transcript (for older kids)**: Subject/Theme | Activities | Skills | Evidence (link/photo) | Date. Map to "credits" if you need to report for homeschool requirements.

**Parent portfolio (for future resumes/applications)**: Projects shipped | Places | Collaborations | Languages/skills | References

### What about private schools?

You can redirect tens of thousands each year from private school into a worldschooling lifestyle—swapping tuition for travel, tutors, museum passes, and experiences that build a global network and practical skills. If you want to homeschool and can perpetual travel, you may be able to share with your school that you're permanently leaving your country, then be free to travel. It will depend if you need to maintain a permanent residence in your home country and rules for your particular native country.

## Strategy 9: Diversify Your Income Streams

Although I currently have a full time remote work role, I've spent time over the years building side hustles. A lot of the time I've burned out before being able to make the opportunities work. Now, with the support of AI tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com) and [Claude](https://claude.ai), I feel empowered with agents who get the work done for me, far more efficiently than I could ever hope to achieve on my own.

I started [World Travel Ambitions](https://worldtravelambitions.com) around 2019 with the hope to turn it into a funded travel blog. 2020 hit and with it, my dream of a blog definitely diminished. Our savings were running very low, and travel blogging wasn't profitable at that time.

In 2023, I decided to give Master Resell Rights (MRR) a try. I had some success, but again burned out with the constant churn of posting all the time, while trying to also parent, getting sick, sick daughter and not enough sleep. I founded [How to Fund Travel](https://howtofund.travel) at that time and hired a VA for the initial work. I was paying my VA, but not really making enough to cover the cost. When I let the VA go, I had big plans to work on the SEO and design, but never really found the time to do anything again.

In 2025, my work handed me a tool, [Cursor](https://cursor.com). And I learned about Vibe Marketing and SEO with AI. I felt like I had an opportunity to bring my old dreams to life with a lot less time investment.

Now, I've relaunched [How To Fund Travel](https://howtofund.travel). I've started a free membership site, [Vibe Nomads](https://vibenomads.org), and I am again on the journey to creating sustainable online income streams leveraging AI and SEO.

I think this side of things is really important to any family wanting more time freedom.

### Income ideas to consider next

- **Digital products**: niche ebooks, templates, checklists, or mini‑courses for traveling parents. Start with [Building an Online Business to Fund Your Travels](/blog/fundtravelbuildonlinebusiness).
- **Affiliate marketing**: tools you genuinely use (eSIMs, travel gear, productivity apps, courses); bake links into helpful guides. Learn more in [Travel the World on Autopilot: Easy Affiliate Income Streams](/blog/fundtravelaffliliateincomes).
- **Services**: part‑time consulting, design, SEO/AI setup, or async coaching with fixed "office hours."
- **Sponsorships/UGC**: brand collaborations tied to travel family life; keep it values‑aligned and disclose clearly.
- **Community + subscriptions**: paid tiers inside Vibe Nomads (workshops, templates, office hours) once the free tier is thriving.
- **Lightweight SaaS/automations**: AI‑powered micro‑tools, Notion systems, or GPT agents that solve 1 clear problem.

## Strategy 10: Prioritize Self-Care and Family Connection

Remote work + family travel is a marathon. The only way it's fun and sustainable is if everyone's cup gets filled—sleep, movement, community, and simple, reliable rituals.

### The Burnout Prevention Plan (our guardrails)

- Sleep first: lights out early. Blackout curtains helps and so does white noise. Fans in hot climates are great.
- Movement daily: beach walks, pool laps, yoga mats always out.
- Sun + water: morning sunlight, hydrate - 1L of water before coffee. For me, sadly, coffee is off-limits as I suffer from insomnia whenever I drink wonderful coconut coffee
- Buffer days: no calls the day after long-haul travel; admin/errands only.
- No‑meeting windows: protect golden hours and dinner time.
- 90‑day cadence: 6–12 weeks or more "slowmad" with 1–2 weeks lighter travel.

### Quality Family Time (not just "more time")

- Anchor rituals: beach afternoons 2–3x/week, Saturday brunch, Sunday sunset walk.
- Micro‑moments: 10‑minute tea chats, balcony reading, bedtime debrief.
- Tech rules: phones off at meals, one photo rule then pockets.
- Teen strategy: plan longer stays where other teens stick around; book one "their choice" activity weekly.
- One‑on‑one time: weekly date with each kid; rotate.

### Self‑Care for Traveling Parents (what we actually do)

- Me: Five Tibetan Rites most mornings, mums' nights monthly, herbal spa/sauna 2x/month, weekly massage when possible, beach + pool days, brunch dates, quiet art/reading with my teen daughter.
- Him: daily sports if possible—pickleball, basketball, beach touch rugby; community keeps his mental health strong.
- Home kit: multiple yoga mats, resistance bands, lacrosse ball, magnesium, Kindle.

### Relationship Maintenance

- Weekly planning date: 45 minutes on money, moves, meals, and moments (what will make this week feel good?).
- Daily 10‑minute check‑in: feelings, schedules, help needed.
- Monthly "us" time: simple dinner, no logistics talk after the first 10 minutes.
- Extended family: schedule standing video calls; share a monthly photo/notes album.

### Our simple weekly rhythm (copy‑paste)

- Mon–Thu: split‑shift work, beach/pool afternoons, quiet‑time reading.
- Fri: light meetings only, family activity or friend meetup.
- Sat: adventure + long brunch.
- Sun: slow morning, sunset walk, 45‑minute planning date.

### 24‑Hour Reset (when it all goes sideways)

- Sleep early + hydrate + protein breakfast.
- 30‑minute movement + 15‑minute tidy/reset the space.
- One deep‑work block; defer everything else.
- Family hour outdoors; early dinner; off screens at 8 p.m.

### Boundaries you can say out loud

- "We don't book travel on meeting‑heavy days."
- "No calls after dinner; next overlap is tomorrow at [time]."
- "We travel slow: minimum 4 weeks per stop when we're all busy."

### Where we choose to stay (to enable this)

- Near a quiet beach/park, walkable cafes, and community sports.
- A door that closes for calls, plus space for yoga mats.
- Neighborhoods with family meetups and teen‑friendly hangouts.

### Start Small, Think Big

Remember, you don't need to implement all 10 strategies at once. Start with the ones that resonate most with your current situation—perhaps time blocking (Strategy 1) and accommodation selection (Strategy 2). As you gain confidence and experience, gradually incorporate more strategies into your routine.

The work-travel lifestyle isn't for everyone, but for families who embrace the challenges and opportunities it presents, the rewards can be extraordinary. Your children will grow up with a global perspective, you'll have the flexibility to work from anywhere, and together you'll create memories that last a lifetime.
